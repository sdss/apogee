The contents of this folder are as follows:

interpol_modeles.f - fortran code to interpolate MARCS model atmospheres for a given set of parameters and generate an interpolated model and a file containing departure coefficients interpolated for the given paraemeters (*_coef.dat)

interpol.script - a bash script to run interpol_modeles.f

NLTEdata/ - a folder containing binary files of grids of departure doefficients computed by MULTI for the entire MARCS grid or a given subset, and auxiliary data files that interpol_modeles uses to search and extract the needed information from the binary grid. You likely don't need all of the binary files (they are large and take a while to download). Just choose the ones for the elements you want to use/test. 

Testout/ - a folder containing some sample output

How to run the interpolator:

1. compile using either an Intel or GNU fortran compiler using the following command:
		>gfortran -o interpol_modeles interpol_modeles.f
   (where gfortran can be replaced with ifort, and the -o command names the compiled output to    "interpol modeles")
2. run the interpol.script after changing the necessary lines (such as what parameters are needed and what values bracket those parameters) using the following command:
         >./interpol.script

The interpolator does a simple linear interpolation between three dimensions: Teff, logg, and [Fe/H] and outputs the results.
