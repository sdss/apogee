             Uploaded files for Ca and Mg models from MULTI. These both include a csv file with the departure coefficients, and a file with "ID, energy, configuration, and stat. weight for every level". The b-b and b-f transitions are not in this file, but Ekaterina can include them later if needed. If Mg is too difficult to use for debugging, we can use Ca.
